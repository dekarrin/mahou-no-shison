a long time ago, some kitsune youkai was all out and doing their thing, this and that. Maybe they
annoyed the wrong person, or maybe it was more like they didn't cause any harm, but some trick or
something or either really pissed someone off. Such that, they came after it with weapons to attack
it, nyaa!

A woman who loved the land and the countryside and tried her best not to harm anyone kept the kitsune
hidden in her basement. When the cause harm man came and tried to ask if the kitsune was there, she
said that no, she hadn't seen it.

And so, in a rage, the man set fire to the forest, and began to deface the mountains and redirect the
streams, kill the grass. The woman tried to stop him, and offered herself in the place of the kitsune,
showing a transformation as proof of the mysterious power. this was taught to her at that time. Just
as she was about to be killed, the kitsune magnified the sun on the man's eyes, causing him to lose
sight and letting the woman get away.

The man never was able to see quite right again, and his crops were always poor from then on.

This is the first time the power of transformation passed from youkai to human, and she retained this
ability, as it could be taught but required latent desire to do good, a sense of purity; smth like that
