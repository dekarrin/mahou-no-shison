============================================
KUSANAGI INSTITUTE /
KUSANAGI GAKUIN KOUTOUGAKKOU (草梛学院高等学校)
============================================
This is a school that was established on the basis of training up Magical Girls. Specifically, they
deal with the use of transformation powers, management of abilities, and ethical training, as well
as all of the other aspects of a typical education.

In order to keep the education of MGs hidden, the fact that this school is does such training is not
advertised, although it is not considered a secret.


=============
MAGICAL GIRLS
=============
A Magical Girl is a person who is capable of using extraordinary abilities for the protection of
people. A Magical Girl is trained to use her abilities at a school such as the one listed above.

Most all MGs' manifests by undergoing some kind of transformation into their alternate form, in
which they can use some kind of power amplification device (typically a wand, baton, or other
hand-held object) in order to use their abilities.

The Magical Girls are the last offshoot of the ancient shinto religions. Many of their graduates
are not magical girls in the strictest sense, but often keep their abilities hidden except in the
most dire of situations. Virtually every shrinekeeper has had some kind of training in this aspect.

Because MGs have such an extraordinary amount of power, their power is a highly regulated thing.
All graduates are tracked by a central authority.

MGs are taught to only use powers when necessary, and to respect all things in nature. Also, they
are taught to sacrafice themselves.

Most all MGs are female; the male ones are very few and far between, and thus they are now known as
Magical Girls rather than Magical Children.

Some MGs end up using their power for bad stuff. These are known as Fallen. Known ones are kept
under the eye of the org. Most of the Fallen Girls simply use their powers for petty personal gain;
the org is rather hands-off when it can be, and so they only really pursue those who become
obsessed with power.


==========
PHILOSOPHY
==========

As a whole, the MG school generally teaches basics to Japanese culture, it just takes it much
further. It grants great favor to purity of self in an attempt to try and keep things same. Loss of
purity leads to loss of powers, but the question is where exactly this loss of purity manifests.
According to the school, this is purity as is traditionally held, that of body, but in actuality it
is in purity of intention and genuineness to one's virtues and self. All types of purity are
traditionally inexplicably linked (and with good reason considering the history of those who have
lost body purity), with no one really wanting to break from tradition at all.

The school teaches that the most important thing is purity as an ideal. Thus, it involves training
for various ways of interacting with nature. Many times, some novices believe the point of it all is
to get good at fighting, but really it's to commune with the latent forces that make up the world,
building up a link and living in harmony with them. This is why many graduates go on to do things
such as serve in various shrines, though some may go on to pursue more scholarly ventures, perhaps
serving as the local oracle/sage.

Naturally, the happiness of all things is raised as an important point. Humans in particular are not
seen as special in this regard, everything should be respected.
