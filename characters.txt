===============
The Protagonist
===============
The male attendee of the special school. He is fairly laid-back, rather to the point of not getting much of
anything done. Enjoys watching TV, does not very much enjoy doing work. Grades are rather lackluster. Lives
with parents in house rented from aunt. Due to grades not being good, parents decide to enroll him right away
in the school upon receiving the invitation. During their initial investigation, they do not find out the MG
angle, and so decide to go ahead with it.

Has a younger sister. She is three years younger. Though they used to be close as children, as they entered
their teenage years they grew apart and started to have their relationship deteriorate, especially as she was
very task-driven as opposed to his laziness.
