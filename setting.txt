===================
KOUTOUGAKKOU (KTGK)
===================
This is a school that was established on the basis of training up Magical Girls. Specifically, they
deal with the use of transformation powers, management of abilities, and ethical training, as well
as all of the other aspects of a typical education.

In order to keep the education of MGs hidden, the fact that this school is does such training is not
advertised, although it is not considered a secret.

=============
MAGICAL GIRLS
=============
A Magical Girl is a person who is capable of using extraordinary abilities for the protection of
people. A Magical Girl is trained to use her abilities at a school such as the one listed above.

Most all MGs' manifests by undergoing some kind of transformation into their alternate form, in
which they can use some kind of power amplification device (typically a wand, baton, or other
hand-held object) in order to use their abilities.

The Magical Girls are the last offshoot of the ancient shinto religions. Many of their graduates
are not magical girls in the strictest sense, but often keep their abilities hidden except in the
most dire of situations. Virtually every shrinekeeper has had some kind of training in this aspect.

Because MGs have such an extraordinary amount of power, their power is a highly regulated thing.
All graduates are tracked by a central authority.

MGs are taught to only use powers when necessary, and to respect all things in nature. Also, they
are taught to sacrafice themselves.

Most all MGs are female; the male ones are very few and far between, and thus they are now known as
Magical Girls rather than Magical Children.

Some MGs end up using their power for bad stuff. These are known as Fallen. Known ones are kept
under the eye of the org. Most of the Fallen Girls simply use their powers for petty personal gain;
the org is rather hands-off when it can be, and so they only really pursue those who become
obsessed with power.


Brainstorming
-------------

could take place in some kind of school for magical girls, kind of like Hogwarts? But for mgs.
Ooh! Naturally this would make for a very smooth transition into kemonomimi. Transfrom! Poof!
Now you have dog ears! Or something as such. CAREFUL with this so as not to use it if it feels
forced.
- Then why, as a male, is the protag there at an all-girls?
- Teacher? A bit odd, plus sounds a bit too much like Don't take it Personally.
- First male student allowed?
 - This would not normally be okay - also, given the type of school, protag needs significant
   reason to want to go there.
   - Maybe if protag were non heteronorm. still need some reason. Argh, a trans girl tho...
   isn't that a bit too preachy? idk. Decent idea, save it for later to see if develops. Would limit
   hs romance to f/f. Hm. Maybe trying to get through all this in spite of non-passing? Like, REALLY
   bad passing. Actually, even if protag doesn't roll like this, this could be an okay plotline for
   at least one char. CAREFUL - preachiness lies just around the corner with this one.
   ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE THIS FOR THE PROTAG. This will drop relatability by an obscene amount.
   - Protag really wants to protect somebody/watch out for sister or something like that. Probably
   not romantic-type love (probably).
   - Protag DOESN'T go to school here, but rather interacts with the characters on a day to day
   basis. This seems really tricky; like, why isn't HE in school at this time? Delinquint? Seems like
   a pretty terrible person. Hm. Maybe interesting. Have to throw in an element of avoiding all authority
   figures though. And for that matter, most all students. Why would a student accept a male there?
   No, would likely have to at least be in a situation where most people accept his presence if the
   main story is to take place here.
  - Why would the school deciding to allow male students? Affirmative action could pry be applied if
  American; highly doubt that Japan would ever touch this one though. Need some research on this.
  How likely is it that a Japanese girl's school ever open its doors to guys? I suspect not likely,
  but again we shall see.

So perhaps it could be a kind of school that is not exclusively female only, but it is by invite only,
and invitations are only ever extended to gals. That's fine, but then a slip-up causes an invite to be
sent to protag, who sees it as a good school. So why did protag get invite? Perhaps they watch graduates
whose ancestors went there! Aha! A sublease! Proto is living in a house whose prev occupant/official
owner is actually a grad of the school, and so naturally they submit a request for invitation to the
eldest child. Parents recieve, overjoyed, yay! Guess what proto, you go to this school now.

Typically, mgs are required to be registered with a particular agency, and they must usually submit a
change of address form. But the last one does not, because the paperwork gets destroyed.
Ah no! We invited a guy? Well, no rule says that they can't be in it! Super upbeat happiness by the
adminstrators, swear to god every single one of them just rolls with the trouble. Since the process of
enrollment is automatic, the studnet will be allowed, and they will not go back on their word of
invitation.

But now, as for the student's relectance to do such a thing. Why would proto-san want to go?
1. - He's a seventeen-year-old guy. Yay, girls!
2. - He's a bit of a slacker, and so that by the time that he finds out, it's a bit too late
     to not go.
3. - Moved in recently, and so not much time.

Ugh, this seems kind of contrived, but I think that it could work.
