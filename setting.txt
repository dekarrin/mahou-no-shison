============================================
KUSANAGI INSTITUTE /
KUSANAGI GAKUIN KOUTOUGAKKOU (草梛学院高等学校)
============================================
This is a school that was established on the basis of training up Magical Girls. Specifically, they
deal with the use of transformation powers, management of abilities, and ethical training, as well
as all of the other aspects of a typical education.

In order to keep the education of MGs hidden, the fact that this school is does such training is not
advertised, although it is not considered a secret.

MAGICAL GIRLS
=============
A Magical Girl is a person who is capable of using extraordinary abilities for the protection of
people. A Magical Girl is trained to use her abilities at a school such as the one listed above.

Most all MGs' manifests by undergoing some kind of transformation into their alternate form, in
which they can use some kind of power amplification device (typically a wand, baton, or other
hand-held object) in order to use their abilities.

The Magical Girls are the last offshoot of the ancient shinto religions. Many of their graduates
are not magical girls in the strictest sense, but often keep their abilities hidden except in the
most dire of situations. Virtually every shrinekeeper has had some kind of training in this aspect.

Because MGs have such an extraordinary amount of power, their power is a highly regulated thing.
All graduates are tracked by a central authority.

MGs are taught to only use powers when necessary, and to respect all things in nature. Also, they
are taught to sacrafice themselves.

Most all MGs are female; the male ones are very few and far between, and thus they are now known as
Magical Girls rather than Magical Children.

Some MGs end up using their power for bad stuff. These are known as Fallen. Known ones are kept
under the eye of the org. Most of the Fallen Girls simply use their powers for petty personal gain;
the org is rather hands-off when it can be, and so they only really pursue those who become
obsessed with power.
