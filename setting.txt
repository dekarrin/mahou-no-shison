Brainstorming

could take place in some kind of school for magical girls, kind of like Hogwarts? But for mgs.
- Then why, as a male, is the protag there?
- Teacher? A bit odd, plus sounds a bit too much like Don't take it Personally.
- First male student allowed?
 - This would not normally be okay - also, given the type of school, protag needs significant
   reason to want to go there.
   - Maybe if protag were non heteronorm. still need some reason. Argh, a trans girl tho...
   isn't that a bit too preachy? idk. Decent idea, save it for later to see if develops. Would limit
   hs romance to f/f. Hm. Maybe trying to get through all this in spite of non-passing? Like, REALLY
   bad passing. Actually, even if protag doesn't roll like this, this could be an okay plotline for
   at least one char. CAREFUL - preachiness lies just around the corner with this one.
   - Protag really wants to protect somebody/watch out for sister or something like that. Probably
   not romantic-type love (probably).
   - Protag DOESN'T go to school here, but rather interacts with the characters on a day to day
   basis. This seems really tricky; like, why isn't HE in school at this time? Delinquint? Seems like
   a pretty terrible person. Hm. Maybe interesting. Have to throw in an element of avoiding all authority
   figures though. And for that matter, most all students. Why would a student accept a male there?
   No, would likely have to at least be in a situation where most people accept his presence if the
   main story is to take place here.
  - Why would the school deciding to allow male students? Affirmative action could pry be applied if
  American; highly doubt that Japan would ever touch this one though. Need some research on this.
  How likely is it that a Japanese girl's school ever open its doors to guys? I suspect not likely,
  but again we shall see.
